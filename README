Usage
=====

Direct usage:

  objdump -dr input.o | ./objtool.awk

Loop over all kernel objects under a given path:

  loop <path>

Note that "loop" will use binutils-s390x-linux-gnu's objdump (available in EPEL
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) if installed, otherwise the local version.


Verbose
-------

By default objtook.awk only reports on functions that match its search
heuristic.  It can report on all functions when put into verbose mode:

  objdump -dr input.o | ./objtool.awk -v verbose=1

  - or -

  verbose=1 ./loop linux/ | grep :: | wc -l


Pre-built object files
======================

The linux/ directory consists of object files generated by linux v4.16
'allyesconfig' and CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST.  The report file was created from these
files.
